It is characterized by an exophytic papillary growth with a typical ‘cauliflower like’ appearance. This lesion constitutes about 2 percent of all oral neoplasms and it is believed by many investigators that they are caused by Human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV virus subtypes 6 and 11 have been detected from neoplastic tissues of papilloma in about 50 percent cases, whereas it is found in normal oral tissues in less than 5 percent cases.

  static const clinicalPresentation = '''
• Clinically, papilloma appears as a slow growing, exophytic, soft, usually pedunculated, painless, nodular growth often with a typical “cauliflower-like” appearance.
 
• Papillomas often characteristically have numerous finger-like projections on their surface, which can be either blunt or pointed.
 
• Because of these projections, the papilloma often appears as an ovoid swelling with a rough, corrugated surface.
 
• The size of the lesion is usually small and that varies from few millimeters to about one centimeter in diameter.
 
• The base of the lesion can be either pedunculated or sessile (broad based) but papilloma is mostly a well-circumscribed growth.
 
• The lesion is mostly white in color and is firm in consistency as the surface is highly keratinized.

• Sometimes superficial ulceration and secondary infection may occur especially in those lesions in the oral cavity, which are often subjected to trauma.
 
• A papilloma with non-keratinized surface may also occur and in such cases it will appear pinkish or greyish in color and moreover, this type of lesion is usually softer in consistency.
 
• On rare occasions, papillomas may grow in an inwardly direction (inverted type) instead of growing in the usual exophytic manner. Such lesions are mostly seen in the lateral nasal wall, paranasal sinuses and in the maxillary antrum, etc. Moreover, they have great tendency for local destruction and malignant transformation.
 
• Multiple papillomas may sometimes coalesce together and form a large lesion in the oral cavity and the condition is commonly known as ‘papillomatosis’.
 
• Papillomatosis of oral mucosa may sometimes occur in association with skin disorders e.g. Focal dermal hypoplasia syndrome, Nevus unius lateris, Cowden syndrome and Acanthosis nigricans, etc.

• “Nevus unius lateris” is a dermal condition in which papillomatous growths can be seen in the trunk and limbs, with a unilateral distribution. Oral papillomatous lesions can occur in this disease and involves the lips, tongue and the palate.

Microscopically, papillomas present the following features:
• Proliferating keratinized stratified squamous epithelium in the form of multiple fingers-like projections.

• Every single finger-like projection has a fibrovascular connective tissue core in the center, which contains few inflammatory cells.

• The covering squamous epithelium shows hyperkeratosis and acanthosis. Thickening of the keratin is seen in lesions which are clinically whiter.

• Although most of the papillary projections are long and finger-like, there can be some projections, which are short, round and blunt.

• In the spinus cell layer ‘koilocytes’ are sometimes seen, these are virus-altered epithelial clear cells with small dark (pyknotic) nuclei.

• In some lesions, slightly increased mitotic activity can be seen in the basal layer of the epithelium, which results in mild epithelial hyperplasia.

• There can be little cellular atypia in some papillomas, however, the dysplastic changes in the epithelium is rarely found.

• Papilloma is not a premalignant lesion and malignant transformation in pre-existing oral papillomas has not been documented.

class PigmentedCellularNevus{
  static const String definition = '''
A nevus can be defined as a congenital, developmental, tumor-like malformation of the skin or mucous membrane.
  
The term “nevus” has got several meanings; in Latin terms nevus means birth marks, however, the common lay term used for nevus is “mole”.

Nevus is composed of “nevus cells” which are neuroectodermal in origin, these cells, except for their tendency to form cell nests and their less prominent dendritic processes, are nothing but melanocytes or their precursors. After their formation, nevus cells migrate through the peripheral nerves and finally reach to the basal layer of the skin or mucous membrane. Nevi are usually present at birth or they can be seen any time after birth.

The function of nevus cells is to produce melanin, this pigment, after being synthesized within the nevus cells is passed on to the adjacent keratinocytes of the oral mucous membrane. Although nevus cells produce melanin pigments, not all these cells are always equally pigmented. The amount of pigmentation in a nevus does not depend on the number of pigment producing nevus cells present in it, instead, it depends solely upon the amount of pigment produced by its individual constituent cell.

Different types of nevi:
         
• Intradermal (intramucosal) nevus.                                       
• Junctional nevus.

Site: The neoplasm commonly occurs (over 85 percent cases) over the hair-bearing areas of facial skin (especially the mucocutaneous areas) in blonde, white males. 
 
The orofacial areas particularly vulnerable to these lesions are the upper lip, nasolabial folds, periorbital region, cheek, forehead and ear, etc.

• One or more telangiectatic blood vessels may be seen coursing over the lesion and moreover, a characteristic pearly opalescence is noticed when the tumor is digitally pressed.

• The untreated neoplasm enlarges and invades adjacent tissues and organs by direct extension but it rarely metastasizes.

• The lesions on the buccal mucosa are sometimes very extensive and they often cause pain, tenderness and difficulty in taking food.

• Verrucous carcinoma of the gingiva or the alveolar mucosa rapidly becomes fixed to the underlying periosteum and causes gradual invasion and considerable amount destruction of the jaw bone.

Histologically verrucous carcinoma presents the following features:

• The tumor is composed of highly differentiated malignant epithelial cells, which proliferate as broadly papillary structures.

• The tumor cells are locally invasive in nature although distant metastasis is rare in verrucous carcinoma.

• Verrucous carcinoma is a low grade malignancy and the neoplastic cells often lack the usual cytologic criteria of malignancy.

• The hyperplastic epithelium often exhibits a papillary surface, being covered by a thick layer of parakeratin.

• The continuity of the surface is maintained by filliform or broader processes of well differentiated squamous cells and these processes often resemble “church spires”.

• The lesion is slow growing and the neoplastic cells spread laterally more rather than vertically.

• Massively enlarged, bulb-like, acanthotic reteridges are seen, which often invaginate into the underlying connective tissue stroma.

• Many deep cleft-like spaces lined by thick layer of parakeratin, often extend from the surface of the epithelium and project deep into the center of the bulbous rete rides, this phenomenon is known as “parakeratin-plugging.”

• All the bulbous rete-ridges of the epithelium tend to project into the underlying connective tissue at more or less the same level and this is known as “pushing margin”.

• In verrucous carcinoma the malignant epithelial cells are usually well- differentiated, mitosis is rare or absent and the cells exhibit almost normal level of maturation.

• The epithelial cells seldom exhibit severe dysplastic changes and there is usually no abnormal mitotic activity found in these cells.

• Moreover, besides having some basilar or parabasilar hyperchromatism, there is not even any cytologic atypia seen in the epithelium.

• Formation of epithelial pearls and microcysts are often seen in verrucous carcinoma. The interface between the tumor and the adjacent normal epithelium is well demarcated.

• The basement membrane is almost always intact and the underlying connective tissue shows an intense inflammatory reaction, with numerous chronic inflammatory cell infiltrations in the area.

• The cells may be round, polyhedral or fusiform in nature and these are either mononucleated or multiancleated.

• Mitotic activity is usually numerous and these tumor cells often produce huge amounts of melanin pigments.

• However, in some lesions melanin production by the tumor cells can be very little and on few occasions there can be virtually no melanin production.

According to the arrangement of the tumor cells, malignant melanomas can be divided into three specific histologic patterns:

• Hutchinson’s freckle type: 
  • Histologically, these lesions are characterized by proliferation of pleomorphic, palisaded, malignant melanocytes in a horizontal direction along the epidermal-dermal junction.
  
  • These atypical tumor cells do not invade into the upper layers of the epithelium.
                                                                                             
• Superficial spreading type:
  • This type of melanoma is histologically characterized by the presence of numerous, large, atypical melanocytes within the epithelial layer and the cells exhibit abundant pale cytoplasm.
 
  • The cells are arranged in small, round clusters at the epidermal-dermal interface with few areas of focal microinvasions.
 
  • The term “pagetoid” is often used to describe the clear cells in the unique intraepithelial growth pattern in this superficial spreading type of melanoma.
 
  • Excessive amount of melanin is often produced by these atypical malignant, melanocytes, moreover, melanin can also be present within the macrophages which are present in the vicinity.
                                                                                 
• Invasive type: 
  • The invasive types of melanomas are usually nodular lesions and are characterized by vertical pattern of growth of the malignant, melanocytes, which frequently invade the underlying connective tissue.
  
  • The malignant pleomorphic cells can be either spindle or ovoid shaped and some cells can be even polygonal in appearance. These cells produce variable amount of melanin pigments.

class SquamousCellCarcinoma{
  static const definition ='''
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant epithelial tissue neoplasm of the oral cavity, which is derived from the stratified squamous epithelium. Since oral squamous cell carcinomas constitute bulk of the oral malignancies (above 90 percent) it is thus commonly referred to as oral cancer (although there are several other malignancies of the oral cavity besides squamous cell carcinoma).
 ''';
  static const epidemiology ='''
• Squamous cell carcinoma is also termed as epidermoid carcinoma and it is by far the most common malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity, representing about 90 percent of all oral cancers. For this reason, oral squamous cell carcinomas are often designated as “oral cancers”.

• The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma varies in different countries and also in different population groups.

• On an average, oral squamous cell carcinomas represent about 3 percent of all cancers in males and about 2 percent of all cancers in females.

• This disease is responsible for 2 percent of all annual deaths in males and 1 percent of all annual deaths in females.

• The incidence of oral cancer varies in different countries depending upon the frequency of tobacco usage and other related habits throughout the world.

• The general trend indicates that the incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma increases alarmingly in the societies, where extensive tobacco use begins in the early life and is continued for a longer period.

• The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma increases with age and most of the cases occur usually after the age of 40 years.

• Although, oral squamous cell carcinomas can arise from virtually any intraoral site, but they develop more frequently from the lower lip, lateral borders of the tongue, buccal mucosa and floor of the mouth, etc.

• In the ICD (International Classification of Diseases-WHO-1977), oral cancer is described in a group comprising of different numbers depending upon the site of involvement of the disease.

• According to this ICD classification, oral cancers are numerically categorized in the following manner:
  – lip cancer–ICD No. 140,                                  
  – tongue cancer–ICD No. 141,                               
  – cancer of the gingiva and alveolar mucosa ICD 
    No. 143,                     
  – Cancer of the floor of the mouth–ICD No. 144                
  – Cancer of other parts of the mouth-ICD No. 145.               
         
• The annual age-adjusted incidence rates of oral cancer per 100,000 (one lakh) population varies from continents to continents, from countries to countries and also from places to places within the same country.

• In Europe, it varies from 2.0, in UK to 9.4, in France, in USA it varies from 4.4, in Columbia to 13.4 in Canada.

• In Asia, the annual incidence rates of oral cancer per one lakh population varies from 1.6 in Japan to as high as 13.5 in India.

• Australia and New Zealand also exhibits similar trends and here the incidence varies from 2.6 in New Zealand to 7.5 in South Australia.

• In Sri Lanka, the oral cancers constitute about 40 percent of all malignancies.

• In the Manipuri districts in India, the annual incidence rate of oral cancer is about 21.4 per one lakh population (Wahi 1968).

• Survey among textile mill workers in Ahmedabad (Gujarat), India, indicates that the average incidence rate of oral cancer among individuals above 35 years of age is 25 per one lakh population (Malaowalla et al).

• In a house to house 10 year follow-up study, Gupta et al (1980) have reported the annual age-adjusted incidence rate of oral cancer in Ernakulam and Srikakulam districts as 16 and 21 respectively per one lakh population.

• In UK, oral cancers account for 1 percent of all malignancies, in USA, they account for about 2 to 4 percent, however in India they account for about 30 to 40 percent of all malignant tumors and in some cases the figure may be as high as about 50 percent. • Recent trends besides few exceptions, indicate that the incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer are declining and it can be due to the reduced exposure to various etiological agents.

  static const role ='''
• One person dies in every 10 seconds in the world due to the use of tobacco.

• Epidemiological and experimental studies categorically indicate that tobacco plays an important role in the development oral cancer.

• Tobacco is used in various smoking forms like cigarettes, cigars, pipes and beedes, etc.

• It can also be used in smokeless forms like panbeetel quid, snuff, tobacco sachets (khaini), zarda and other popular forms.

Mechanism of Action of Tobacco in Carcinogenesis:-

There are about 300 carcinogens found in tobacco smoke, which include: aromatic hydrocarbonbenzopyrine and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TsNs), N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosodimetheylamine (NDMA) etc. In our body these carcinogenic agents produce DNA adduct (it is a piece of DNA covalently bonded to a cancer causing chemical) called O-6-methylguanine, which interferes with the DNA replication and thereby cause mutation. Mutations open the floodgate of molecular chain of events leading eventually to carcinogenic change in cells.

There are several supportive evidences, which can establish the relationship between the use of tobacco and the occurrence of oral cancer:

• Studies indicate that the incidence of oral cancer is four times greater among pipe or cigar smokers as compared to the non- smokers. The common tobacco related diseases include (a) carcinoma of the lung, bladder, pancreas, oral cavity, esophagus, pharynx and larynx, etc. (b) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and (c) coronary arterial diseases.

• Pipe and cigarette smoking have been linked with carcinoma of the lips for many years.

• Different studies also indicate that persons those who are smoking forty or more cigarettes per day have a significantly increased risk of oral cancer (ranging from about 10 to 20 times) more than that of the non-smokers.

• The type of tobacco (variation in tar, nicotine and nitrosamine content), its curing technique used by the manufacturer, species of tobacco and methods used by the patient for smoking can influence the relative risk of oral cancer to a large extent. For example, high incidence of oral cancer in India could be partly due to the widespread smoking of beedes (country made cigarette made up of crude tobacco).

• The habit of reverse smoking (if the burning end of the cigarette is kept inside the mouth while smoking) definitely increases the risk of oral cancer especially among women.

• Reports indicate that the relative risk of oral cancer for reverse smokers is about forty times higher than those who do not smoke.

• Long-term follow-up studies also indicate that about one third of the patients who have been successfully treated for oral or oropharyngeal cancers will develop new (second) cancers if they continue smoking after treatment. On the other hand, smokers who stop smoking after getting their fast cancer, successfully treated will carry only a small risk of developing another lesion.

• Research indicates that excessive use of tobacco, heavy consumption of alcohol and poor diet together cause increased incidence of oral cancer. 

Smokeless Tobacco-Betel Quid (Pan) and other Chewing Habits:-

• Chewing of pan is a popular habit all over the world and it is practiced by over 200 million people in different countries.

• This habit is particularly more common in Southeast Asia and India.

• Pan is made up of several ingredients like betel nut, lime, tobacco, catechu and other spices, which are wrapped within a betel leaf.

• The constituents vary according to the custom, individual taste and economic status, etc.

• The carcinogenic effect of pan chewing could be due to the presence of tobacco as one of its main ingredients.

• Moreover, the possible interactions between different ingredients of pan may results in the formation of some chemicals which might be harmful, for example, shaked lime used in pan may hydrolyze one of the alkaloids of the betal nut called arecoline to produce arecoidene, the later is experimentally proved to be carcinogenic.

• The habit of placing a mixture of tobacco and lime (commonly known as khaini) in oral vestibule is a popular practice in India and Pakistan, which contributes to the occurrence of large number of oral and oropharyngeal cancer cases.

• A large number of people in these countries, particularly the younger generation, are also adapted to the habit of chewing tobacco sachets, which acts as a strong carcinogenic agent. As a result of this, people inclined to such habits develop oral cancer very often.

• Tobacco users can develop oral cancers in their mouth either as direct lesions (de-novo lesions) or such habits may result in the development of precancerous lesions in their mouth like oral submucous fibrosis or leukoplakia, etc. which may turn into malignancy in future, if the habits are continued for long.
''';
  static const alcohol ='''
• Several epidemiological studies have indicated about alcohol as a possible risk factor for oral cancer.

• Both the quantity and quality of alcohol consumed and duration of the habit are crucial factors in this regard. People consuming more amount of alcohol per day, for more number of years will have an increased risk for developing oral cancer than others.

• Inferior quality of the alcohol also increases the risk of oral cancer since these liquors may contain some carcinogenic byproducts.

• Although alcohol has some important role in carcinogenesis, many studies have shown a marked increase in the relative risk of oral cancer when smoking and drinking are practiced together, suggesting a synergistic effect.

Mechanism of Action of Alcohol in Carcinogenesis:-

Alcohol acts as a solvent and facilitates penetration of other carcinogens (especially nitrosonornicotine) across the oral mucous membrane.

Alcohol can cause atrophic change in the oral mucosa, which can therefore make the tissue more vulnerable to the effect of other carcinogenic agents. This often leads to mutagenic change in the epithelial cells. Moreover, the dehydrating effect of alcohol on oral mucosa may further increase the risk of tobacco related damage.

• Long-term alcoholic habit often produces cirhossis  of liver. This disease may be associated with the development of oral cancers in many patients, simply because the damaged liver can not detoxify the carcinogenic chemicals in the blood.
  ''';
  static const diet ='''
• Iron deficiency anemia often causes dysphagia, glossitis and atrophy of the oral mucosa; these changes may increase the risk of malignant transformation of oral mucosa in presence of other carcinogenic agents.

• Deficiencies of certain dietary factors like vitamin A, D, C and E, etc. may cause atrophy of the oral epithelium and thereby make the tissue more vulnerable to various carcinogenic agents.

• The beneficial effect of dietary factor is often badly hampered by the use of alcohol.

• Fresh fruits and vegetables (rich in carotene) provide increased protection against cancer of the mouth, pharynx and larynx, etc.

• Deficiency of certain trace elements like zinc, manganese, magnesium and molybdenum, etc. disturbs the structural integrity of the oral epithelial tissue, as a result of which, the epithelium becomes more vulnerable to the free radical injury. The later may cause development of oral cancer.
''';
  static const dental =''' 
• Ill fitting dentures, poor oral hygiene, faulty restorations, sharp or broken teeth, etc cause persistent irritation and trauma to the oral mucosa and therefore may act as possible predisposing factors in this development of oral cancer.

• Moreover, carcinogenic potential of tobaccoand/or alcohol may be increased significantly in the presence of these orodental factors.

• Chronic oral sepsis is another important contributing factor in the development of oral cancer
''';
  static const uvradiation =''' 
• Ultraviolet radiation is often believed to be responsible for the development of carcinoma of the lip, in fair-skinned people, especially those who are engaged in outdoor activities or professions, e.g. farming, forestry, postal delivery, outdoor games and fishing, etc.

• The ultraviolet radiation penetrates their exposed part of the body easily and thus makes them more vulnerable to cancer.

• Lip cancer caused by ultraviolet radiation is less common among the black or the brown skinned people, since heavy melanin pigmentation in their skin acts as a protective barrier against the ultraviolet radiation.

• The lesion which develops initially is called ‘solar keratosis’ near the vermilion border of the lip and it is a premalignant lesion of long duration. The lip lesion of solar keratosis may gradually turn into squamous cell carcinoma with time.
''';
  static const ionizing =''' 
Squamous cell carcinoma may develop in those areas of the oral cavity, which were exposed to long-term radiation therapy in the past.
''';
  static const viruses =''' 
• Laboratory investigations have shown that certain human cancers may be produced by the oncogenic viruses. For example, the Human papilloma virus (HPV) as well as the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increase the risk of oral cancer and the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type- II increases the risk of cervical cancer among females and oral cancer in males.

• It is often believed that the oncogenic viruses can initiate oncogenesis by altering the DNA and the chromosomal structure of the infected cells and also by inducing some proliferative changes in the host cells.

• The common viruses which might be having some oncogenic potential are as follows: 

  Human Papilloma Virus (HPV):-
    -These viruses probably play some important role in the development of oral premalignant lesions and oral squamous cell carcinomas.
    
  Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV):-
    -The exact role of these viruses in the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas is not well understood and they are probably incidental passenger viruses.
    -Experimental animal studies indicate that development of oral cancers may result from interaction between the oncogenic viruses and the effect of tobacco or smoke, etc.
    
  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV):-
    -Oral squamous cell carcinomas may develop in patients having HIV infection or AIDS, however, the exact role of these viruses in the pathogenesis of oral cancer is not clearly known.
    ''';
  static const immunosuppresion ='''
• Immunosuppression may be associated with an increased risk of oral cancer and it can be seen in patients with HIV infection, who often develop Kaposis sarcoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma.

• The role of immunosuppression in the development of oral carcinoma can further be emphasized by the fact that the HIV infected patients often develop oral cancers at an early age (as compared to the normal age of occurrence for these tumors) and moreover, these tumors develop without the presence of any tobacco or alcohol related habits.

• Increased risk of oral cancers has been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs following renal or other organ transplant treatments.
''';
  static const chronicOral ='''
Candidiasis:-                        
  • Chronic oral candidiasis may occur in association with leukoplakia, the later disease often undergoes malignant transformation.
  • It is believed that candidial infections probably act as cofactors in the transformation of oral premalignant lesions into oral squamous cell carcinomas.
  • Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis often appears as a leukoplakic lesion and it may have some premalignant or malignant potential. 
Syphilis:-                               
Like tobacco and alcohol, syphilis has also been traditionally associated with oral cancers.
  • Tertiary syphilis has often been linked with oral squamous cell carcinomas, particularly the lip or tongue lesions.
  • Experimental studies indicate that long standing syphilitic infections may cause atrophy of the oral epithelium and such atrophic changes may render the epithelial tissue more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco, alcohol and other agents.
  • Definite correlations between syphilitic glossitis and oral cancer has been suspected in the past, however occurence of such mucosal lesions secondary to syphilis, and their coexistence with oral cancers have become rare in recent times.  
  ''';
  static const atmosphericPollution ='''
Vehicular and industrial exhausts contain excessive amount of harmful chemicals, e.g. sulphur, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and several hydrocarbons; these agents increase the risk of oral cancer among people living in cities or in industrial areas.
''';
  static const occupationalHazzard ='''
• People in some occupations may have more risks for developing oral cancers as compared to others. Exposure to hazardous chemicals such as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons etc make the people susceptible to oral cancers.

• It has often been reported that textile workers those who are regularly exposed to particles created by the initial carding of raw cotton wool are especially at risk for this disease.

• Oral cancer incidence is particularly high among people those who are working in rubber, asbestos, woods or chemical industries; and also those who are regularly exposed to gas and soot.

• Apart from this, heavy metal factory workers and people in the printing trade also have an increased tendency for developing oral cancers as compared to others.
''';
  static const geneticFactor ='''
Oral cancers may occur due to the uncontrolled neoplastic proliferation of cells as a result of some abnormal genetic activity.

• It is a multi step event involving multiple sequential mutations to the genes which regulate the system of cell growth and cell multiplication.

• Since the basal cells of the oral epithelium normally have a higher rate of mitotic activity, any factor that causes disturbance in the quality and quantity of the cell regulating proteins can induce a neoplastic growth. .

• Some of these proteins (kinases) interact with the proteins that coordinate the process of cell replication (cyclins). Others are regulatory proteins, which influence the events associated with mitosis. These proteins are produced under the directions of some specific genes on specific chromosomes.

• The specific gene loci responsible for producing proteins that can upset the normal replication cycle of cells are known as “oncogenes”.

• When oncogenes are stimulated to overproduce proteins that stimulate the process of mitosis, the result is neoplastic growth. Alteration in the oncogene activity may be associated with environmental factors such as tobacco habits, alcohol, nutritional deficiency and chronic infections, etc.

 ''';
  static const clinicalFeatures ='''
Age: Carcinomas mostly occur in the older age while sarcomas occur in the younger age. Fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh decade of life is the common age range for oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Sex: The disease affects male people more after than the females and it happens because male people are more frequently exposed to the various deleterious oral habits. Among the oral lesions, lip carcinomas are commonly seen in females. However, recent trends indicate that there is an average increase in the incidence of oral squamous cell carcinomas among females because ladies are becoming more and more attracted towards smoking, drinking alcohol and other related habits.

Sites: The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinomas in various anatomic locations is significantly different, some oral sites are relatively immune to the disease while other sites are particularly more prone to it. Among all oral anatomic areas, lower lip is the most common site, the second most common site is the lateral borders of the tongue. Among all intraoral sites, dorsum of the tongue and hard palate are the least common sites for oral squamous cell carcinoma.
''';
  static const clinicalPresentation ='''
Oral squamous cell carcinoma has a number of different clinical features depending upon its location and its duration of presence in the mouth.

• The most common early appearance of oral squamous cell carcinoma could be extensive oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia.

• The initial lesion may also present an asymptomatic, white or red, varigated patch or a nodule or fissure over the oral mucosa.

• Initially the condition is usually painless and quite innocuous looking however an early biopsy often reveals the real nature of this disease.

• More advanced lesions present either as a fast enlarging, exophytic or invasive ulcer or sometimes as a large tumor mass or a verrucous growth.

• The ulcerated lesion often shows persistent induration around the periphery with an elevated and everted margin.

• In many cases, there is presence of superadded candidial infections.

• The induration is caused by infiltration of the tumor cells deep into the surrounding connective tissue. Moreover, the elevated and everted margin of the lesion occurs due to an increased rate of growth of the epithelial tissue (because of the extensive mitosis of the tumor cells) as compared to the surrounding normal epithelium.

• Floor of the mouth lesions often cause fixation of the tongue to the underlying structures with difficulty in speech and inability to open the mouth (trismus).

• The lesion can be painful either due to secondary infection or due to involvement of the peripheral nerves by the tumor cells. The lesion can also bleed easily.

• When malignant tumor cells invade into the alveolar bone of either maxilla or mandible, they usually cause mobility or exfoliation of regional teeth.

• Involvement of inferior alveolar nerve often causes paresthesia of the lower teeth and the lower lip.

• Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged, tendered and fixed; some of these nodes can be stony hard in consistency.

• In oral squamous cell carcinoma, enlarged lymph nodes do not always indicate metastatic spread of the tumor cells, since this enlargement of lymph nodes may also represent only nonspecific reactive hyperplasias.

• Extensive maxillary lesions may often invade into the maxillary antrum, which often results in nasal bleeding and pressure sensation in the eyeball.

• Untreated lesions of squamous cell carcinoma may sometimes destroy the oral tissues and extend into the skin on the outer surface of the face to produce a nodular or lobulated growth on the facial skin, which appears as an extraoral discharging sinus.

• Involvement of facial skin is significant in squamous cell carcinoma since it indicates a very poor prognosis of the tumor.

• Carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and the tongue are sometimes asymptomatic at least in the early stage of the disease.

• Long standing oral squamous cell carcinomas also produce severe facial disfigurement, difficulty in taking food and difficulty in phonation, etc.

• Pathological fracture of the jaw bone may sometimes occur in untreated cases due to extensive destruction of the bone by the tumor.

• Untreated patients mostly die of cachexia, hemorrhage, secondary infections and aspiration bronchopneumonia, etc.

 Special Aspects of Oral Cancer:- 
 
      Multiple cancer: Multiple cancer refers to the condition in which a patient develops cancer in multiple organs of the body at a time. For example, a patient with oral squamous cell carcinoma may also have cancer of the small intestine, cancer in the lung and in the kidney, etc.
      
      Multicentric cancer: Multicentric cancer means occurrence of two or more separate malignant lesions within a single organ or area of the body, which develop either concurrently (synchronous) or subsequently (metachronous). For example, a patient with tongue cancer may also separately have cancer of the lip or of the buccal mucosa or soft palate, etc. All these malignant lesions may occur either simultaneously or they can develop at certain time intervals.
      
      Oral multicentric cancers probably occur as a result of the phenomenon called “field cancerization”, in which a large wide area of the oral epithelium becomes vulnerable to cancer either by itself or by the influence of certain carcinogenic agents.

  static const lipCarcinoma ='''
• Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip accounts for about thirty to forty percent of all oral cancers and in most of the cases, it is caused by actinic radiation.

• Carcinomas of the lip account for about 12 percent of all head and neck cancers and about 21.5 percent of all intraoral cancers.

• The lesion occurs more commonly among males as compared to females (uncommon in females) and most often the patients are in their fifth to eighth decade of life. However, several cases are also found in young patients below 40 years of age.

• Carcinoma of the lip commonly affects either the left or the right side of the vermilion border and seldom the midline.

• Among the lip carcinomas, the lower lip is affected in about 85 to 95 percent cases; the upper lip is affected in only about 2 to 7 percent cases, while the vermilion border is affected in about 1 to 4 percent cases.

• The lesions are mostly preceded by the precence of long standing keratotic leukoplakia or actinic cheilitis, etc. which are characterized by innocuous looking white plaques on the lip. These conditions are followed by recurrent ulceration or encrustration or an exophytic tumor.

• The ulcer spreads diffusely and the lip becomes everted; and later on the ulcer develops a rolled border with induration of the surrounding tissue.

• Pain, bleeding and paresthesia are common features of lip carcinoma, moreover patient often have difficulty in speech, difficulty in taking food and inability to close the mouth.

• Most lesions in lip carcinoma are small and measure about below 2 centimeter in diameter; however some lesions can be extremely large, which extend either to the facial skin in the adjacent area or to the underlying connective tissue or bone.

• Lip carcinomas are slow to metastasize, however long standing, untreated cases may metastasize to submental lymph nodes and also to the submandibular nodes.

• Carcinoma of the lower lip and commissure are often associated with skin pigmentations.

• Histologically, lip carcinomas are mostly welldifferentiated malignancies (85 percent cases) and if the treatment is done before the metastasis has taken place, prognosis could be as good as 100 percent.

  static const tongueCarcinoma ='''
Tongue is anatomically divided into two parts, anterior two-third area (movable tongue) and posterior one-third area (base). Anterior two-third area is the portion lying anterior to the line of circumvalate papilla on the top and the junction of the ventral surface of tongue to the floor of the mouth below. The posterior one-third area of the tongue is the portion extending from the circumvalate papilla to the junction with the epiglottic vallecula and it includes the pharyngoepiglottic and glossoepiglottic folds.

Carcinoma of the tongue, constitutes about fifty percent of all oral malignancies and out of this, about 25 percent cases affect the lateral borders of posterior one third area of the tongue and 75 percent lesions occur on the anterior two-third area.

• The lateral borders of the tongue and the anterior, right and left floor of the mouth, the retromolar pad and the adjacent parts of the soft palate constitute a “U” shaped zone in the oral cavity, which is considered to be a highrisk area for the development of squamous cell carcinomas.

• The dorsum of the tongue is a relatively resistant site for the initiation of this lesion, although extension from adjacent areas frequently occurs.

• The initial lesions often appear as painless, erythematous macules or nodules or fissured areas over the tongue. There may be some cases of nonhealing ulcers on the lateral border.

• In some cases, the lesion can appear only as an extensive leukoplakic patch, which later on ulcerates and gives rise to a raised, painful and indurated lesion.

• The advanced lesions often produce fast enlarging, painful, exophytic and large, extensively indurated ulcers with elevated and everted margin.

• Squamous cell carcinoma of tongue in advanced stages often spreads to involve the adjacent areas like- gingiva, floor of the mouth, base of the tongue and mandible, etc.

• Tongue lesions usually have excessive bleeding tendency upon silght provocation and often there is presence of superadded candidial infection.

• Squamous cell carcinomas often cause fixation of the tongue to the floor of the mouth, which results in difficulty speech and swallowing, etc.

• Paresthesia of the tongue frequently occurs due to invasion of the lingual nerve by tumor cells.

• Tumor cells from the anterior two-third area of tongue often spread via lymphatics to submandibular, mid-anterior jugular and subdigastric lymph nodes.

• Long standing invasive lesions of posterior onethird area of tongue may spread to any of the following areas, e.g. anterior part, pre-epiglottic space, pharyngeal or laryngeal wall and the mandible, etc.

• Untreated tumors at the tip of tongue tend to spread to the submental and to the juguloomohyoid lymph nodes.

• Tumors at the posterior part of the tongue usually spread to the submandibular and jugulodigastric lymph nodes of either the ipsilateral or the contralateral side.

• Tongue carcinomas have tremendous tendency for metastasis to the neck; the metastatic lymph nodes are enlarged, tendered and are often fixed to the surrounding tissue.

• Tongue lesion extending to the floor of mouth often increases the possibility of nodal metastasis; moreover lesions which cross the median longitudinal raphe can cause contralateral or bilateral nodal involvement.

• Sometimes distant metastasis may occur and in such cases, the malignant tumor cells often spread to the bone or lung or to the brain, etc.

• The prognosis of tongue carcinoma is often excellent if an early diagnosis is made and prompt treatment could be given.

  static const floorCarcinoma ='''
Floor of the mouth is the mucosal area spreading over anterior and lateral floor of the oral cavity. Anteriorly and laterally it is bordered by the lingual surface of lower alveolar ridge, its posterior boundary is formed by the base of tongue and anterior tonsilar pillar. The lingual frenulum divides the floor of mouth into right and left halves, moreover from the front upto the posterior edge of lower second molar is called the anterior zone and the area behind that is called the posterior zone of floor of the mouth.

Floor of the mouth can be the site of about 20 percent of all oral carcinomas and moreover, it is the third most common location of all intraoral squamous cell carcinomas.

• Carcinomas of the floor of the mouth mostly occur in the anterior part (72 percent cases), near the opening of the Wharton’s duct.

• There is absolute male predominance as per as carcinoma of floor of the mouth is concerned (70 to 90 percent lesions occur in males), however recently the female percentage is also on the rise.

• Almost all the patients are either heavy smokers or alcoholics or both.

• The initial lesions often appear either as erythroplakia or speckeled leukoplakia; or a ‘sore spot’ as described by most patients. These lesions gradually undergo central ulceration and exhibit induration at the periphery.

• Carcinomas of the floor of the mouth are among the most fatal and aggressive lesions of oral cavity as they can spread easily to the adjoining structures; moreover as it is the area of rich lymphatic drainage and upto 40 percent patients have nodal involvement during first reporting.

• Gradually the advanced lesions become nodular, ulcerated or indurated, and moreover extension of the tumor cells to the deeper tissues of the tongue often results in fixation of the later.

• These lesions can also extend to the adjoining gingival tissues and cause pain, swelling and bleeding of the gingiva with mobility of the regional teeth.

• Squamous cell carcinomas of the floor of the mouth usually spread to the submandibular lymph nodes. Distant metastasis is also a common.

• Histologically, central giant cell granuloma exhibits a lobulated mass of fibrovascular connective tissue, consisting of numerous proliferating ovoid or spindle shaped stromal cells and variable amount of interlacing collagen fibers.

• Multiple multinucleated giant cells of varying size are dispersed throughout the fibrous tissue stroma, where numerous small blood capillaries are also found.

• Sometimes giant cells may assamle in great numbers in a focal area of the tumor.

• Several areas of hemorrhage and hemosiderin pigmentation are also evident.

• Giant cells are often found around the blood capillaries or near the areas of hemorrhage.

• In central giant cell granuloma, the small giant cells usually contain about 5 nuclei, however the larger giant cells of the same lesion may contain as many as 20 or mere nuclei.

• The stromal cells are plump and spindleshaped and these cells often exhibit frequent mitosis.

• Small foci of osteoids or oven normal bone are often found near the periphery of the lesion.

• There may be little amount of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in the connective tissue stroma, moreover the older lesions may exhibit considerable degrees of fibrosis in the connective tissue stroma.

• Central giant cell granuloma and giant cell tumor of bone one often confused histologically, but the fact is that in central giant cell granuloma the giant cells are relatively less in number and are very irregularly distributed throughout the lesion.

The exact etiopathogenesis of central giant cell granuloma is not known, however few probable causes have been suggested by different investigators which are as follows: 

• According to some investigators, central giant cell granuloma develops as a reparative  process in response to the intrabony hemorrhage or inflammation.

• Some other scientists believe that central giant cell granuloma is a truly neoplastic condition.

• According to other investigators, the lesion occurs as a developmental anomaly and its pathogenesis is similar to that of aneurysmal bone cyst.

In the differential diagnosis of central giant cell granuloma following lesions should be included:
 • Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism
 • Giant cell tumor of bone
 • Ameloblastoma
 • Aneurysmal bone cyst
 • Central odontogenic fibroma
 • Fibrous dysplasia
 • Cherubism
 • Odontogenic keratocyst
 • Calcifying epithelial odontogenic cyst
 • Osteoblastoma.
 • Myxoma.

N.B. It is often difficult to differentiate between central giant cell granuloma and brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism on the basis of clinical, radiological and histopathological features. For this reason biochemical analysis of blood is always necessary. Normally the raised serum calcium and serum alkalyne phosphatase level along with depressed serum phosphate levels confirm the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. However, in cases of central giant cell granulomathe above mentioned biochemical changes in the blood is not observed.

• The color of the lesion ranges from distinctly red to blue or to purple colors. Sometimes, the bright red bosselated lesions of the skin occur which are called “strawberry hemangiomas”.

• After the initial development some of these lesions enlarge continuously while others become static and make no further progress. The mature lesions generally appear dull purple in color.

• Moreover, some lesions of hemangiomas can even resolve slowly and finally disappear completely. After such spontaneous regression of hemangiomas, normal skin color is often restored, however in few cases the skin of the affected site appears atrophic, scarred, wrinkled or telangiectatic.

• When a hemangioma lesion is compressed with the help of a glass microscopic slide, it blanches (reddish color disappears) because the erythrocytes are pushed out of the vascular channels due to pressure. However, once the pressure is released, its reddish appearance returns back due to refilling of the tumor vessels with blood.

• When a hemangioma is connected with a large blood vessel, “bruits” can be heard during auscultation with a stethoscope.

• On palpation hemangioma is always soft, compressible and pulsatile.

• Trauma or laceration to the covering skin or mucosa often causes excessive uncontrolled bleeding from the lesion.

There are several histologic types of hemangiomas found in the oral cavity, among them two very common types are: (a) capillary hemangioma and (b) cavernous hemangioma.

   Capillary Hemangioma:-
     • Capillary hemangiomas are histologically characterized by numerous, minute, small, endothelial-lined capillaries in the lesion, which are densely packed with erythrocytes.
     • The cells of the endothelial lining are usually single layered and are supported by a connective tissue stroma.
     • These cells (endothelial) are well formed, spindle shaped or slightly elongated and plump.
     • Although, well formed capillaries are mainly present throughout the lesion, there may be some foci of proliferating endothelial cells, which form small aggregates or rosettes and these cells often lack in their attempt at vessel formation.
     • The fibrous connective tissue stroma is not well formed and is loosely arranged.
     • Capillary hemangioma often histologically resembles pyogenic granuloma, however, presence of certain features like—intercellular edema and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, etc. are very common in pyogenic granuloma but are rare in case of capillary hemangioma.
      
   Cavernous Hemangiomas 
     • Cavernous hemangiomas histologically reveal large, irregularly shaped, dilated, ‘endotheliallined sinuses’, which contain large aggregates of erythrocytes.
     • These blood-pooled sinuses are often intercommunicating with one another. • A single layer of flattened endothelial cell lines each sinus.
     • These sinuses are of variable caliber and they usually lack a muscular coat on their walls.
     • A mature fibrous connective tissue stroma often separates one sinus from the other.
     • Large areas of hemorrhage and hemosiderin pigmentation are often seen within the cavernous hemangioma lesions.
     • However, inflammatory cell infiltration is very rare unless the lesion is secondarily infected or traumatized.

Port-wine Stain

    • The ‘port-wine stain’ lesions are composed of numerous, microvascular channels, similar to capillary hemangiomas.

• Secondary hemorrhage within the tumor may cause a purple color of the lesion with development of a sudden swelling.

• On palpation, lymphangiomas often produce a typical “crepitate sound”, which occurs due to sudden movement of the intralesional lymphatic fluid from one part of the lesion to the other because of the pressure from palpation.

• Small lesions of lymphangioma sometimes occur on the alveolar ridge of the jawbone, often bilaterally.

• These are painless and asymptomatic in most of the cases, however some lesions can be tendered to palpation.

• Neurilemmoma typically develops in association with a nerve, and as the lesion enlarges the nerve is pushed towards the outer surface of the mass.

• Some lesions may grow at a faster pace with the development of pain and paresthesia. The later symptoms are more often associated with the intraosseous lesions.

• Sometimes small, lobulated, firm growths may occur in relation to the gingiva, which simulate the fibrous epulis.

• Central neurilemmoma of the jaw presents a well-demarcated, bony hard lesion that causes expansion of the cortical plates and sometimes displacement of the regional teeth.

Histologically, neurilemmoma presents the following features:

• The neoplasm is well demarcated from the surrounding normal tissue by a true capsule or a pseudocapsule of fibrous connective tissue.

• The basic cellular constituents of the lesion are the proliferating spindle-shaped, neoplastic Schwann cells, having elongated nuclei.

• These cells are arranged in two distinct patterns, which are pathgnomonic for the neurilemmomas.

• The first pattern is referred to us the Antoni A tissue, which is characterized by parallel rows of palisading nuclei of Schwann cells (regimentation of nuclei).

• The cell cytoplasm cannot be readily delineated since they are blended with the surrounding tissue.

• Often there is presence of two palisaded configurations that are separated from one another by a cell free zone, showing characteristic linear paralleling arrays of collagen fibers.

• The unique configurations of nuclei in ‘Antoni-A’ tissue are often arranged in organoid swirls and are referred to as “verocay bodies”.

• The verocay bodies are eosinophilic acellular areas, consisting of reduplicated basement membrane and cytoplasmic processes.

• The second cellular pattern of neurilemmoma is the Antoni B tissue, which exhibits lack of typical palisading arrangement of the nuclei.

• The cells in Antoni B tissue exhibit randomly arranged cells with oval nuclei within a loose myxomatous stroma this tissue is typically less cellular and less organized.

• Normally in neurilemmoma the ‘Antoni A tissue’ forms multiple nodules, which are interspersed by Antoni B tissues.

• Sometimes, the cells of the Antoni B tissue are very large and hyperchromatic and hence are often confused with malignancy. However neurilemmomas in general have a very little tendency to undergo malignant transformation.

• Long standing lesions of neurilemmoma often exhibit areas of hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrosis and nuclear atypia, etc.

• In multiple neurofibromatosis, the individual neurofibroma lesions are encountered over the skin and as well as the mucosal surfaces. Moreover, neurofibromas in relation to this disease may develop either as nodular lesions or as diffuse lesions.

• The nodular lesions vary in size from few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, they are spherical in shape and often produce multiple, dome-shaped elevations of the skin.
 
• Their number varies from only few to several hundreds and in the oral cavity, these lesions produce diffuse soft tissue overgrowths.

• The diffuse lesions can be quite ‘grotesque’ with formation of pendulous masses, which may envelope an entire extremity.

• These lesions also produce massive flabby soft masses, which emanate from the neck or involve the subcutaneous tissue of the face and scalp.

• Another classic feature of neurofibromatosis is the presence of one or more, large, diffuse, macular brown pigmentations of the skin, which are known as the ‘café-au-lait’ spots. Rarely these café-au-lait spots can be visible on the oral mucosa.

• Solitary neurofibromas are mostly innocuous lesions, however, if these lesions are occurring as part of the disease multiple neurofibromatosis, they show a higher tendency for malignant transformation.

• Expansion, destruction and perforation of the cortical plates are also commonly seen and in most of the cases, the lesion does not produce any new bone at the periosteal front.

• Few lesions cause resorption of roots of the teeth in the affected areas of the jaw, interestingly the resorption often causes tapered narrowing of the teeth and hence, it is called ‘spiking resorption’.

• The osteoblastic type of osteosarcomas commonly exhibit multiple, irregular foci of radiopacities within the large radiolucent zone. This typical appearance may be due to the deposition of newly formed bony trabeculae with in the tumor.

• In osteoblastic type of osteosarcoma, there may be deposition of new bone on the surface of the lesion in a ‘radiating fashion’ and on radiographs it may produce a typical “sun-ray” or a “sunburst” appearance at the periphery (best seen in standard occlusal radiographs).

• At the margin of the tumor, there is lifting of the periosteum and new bone formation, this phenomenon is often known as ‘Codman’s triangle’.

• Early osteosarcomas are characterized by localized, symmetric widening of the periodontal ligament space around the regional teeth. This phenomenon occurs as a result of invasion of the tumor cells into the periodontal ligament space and subsequent destruction of the supporting alveolar bone.

• Loss of supporting bone often causes displacement of the regional teeth from their normal position in the jaw.

• Many lesions osteosarcoma radiologically present the evidence of pathological fractures.

• In contrast to the conventional radiographic pictures, few larger lesions of osteosarcomas may produce only little radiographic changes in the affected part of bone.

• Chest radiographs are mandatory since early lung metastasis is common in case of osteosarcoma.

Histologically, osteosarcomas present highly characteristic features, which are as follows :

• There will be presence of numerous, actively proliferating, spindle-shaped, oval or angular, malignant osteoblast cells within a cellular stroma.

• The tumor cells in osteosarcoma can be either small, uniformly round in shape or they may be large pleomorphic type with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei.

• The malignant osteoblast cells often exhibit cellular pleomorphism, increased abnormal mitosis and nuclear hyperchromatism, etc. Moreover, these cells are often larger than the normal osteoblasts.

• Multiple areas of newly formed bone or osteoid tissues are often present within the fibrous stroma and it is an extremely important characteristic of osteosarcoma.

• The osteoid areas or structures are always bordered at the periphery by the malignant tumor cells.

• Increased mitotic activity may be seen in few lesions, making the tumor an extremely cellular one, with minimum or no tumor bone formations. Histologically, this form of osteosarcoma often resembles the fibrosarcoma.

• In the chondroblastic variants of osteosarcoma, the malignant tumor cells produce large amount of cartilaginous tissues within the tumor, with little or no bone tissue formation. These variants are commonly seen in the oral cavity and they often have a better prognosis.

• Osteosarcomas in few cases may be extremely vascular in nature and exhibit multiple numbers of large, poorly formed, blood vessels within stroma. These types of lesions are known as telangiectatic type of osteosarcomas.

• Well differentiated osteosarcomas often exhibit minimum cellular atypia with abundant bone formations, such lesions are sometimes confused with fibrous dysplasia of bone.

• On rare occasions, there may be presence of giant cells in osteosarcoma.

The combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are usually recommended in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Prognosis is usually poor due to early metastasis of the tumor cells to the lung, brain and other areas. The average fiveyear survival rate is only 10 to 20 percent. Majority of the patients in osteosarcoma die of uncontrolled local spread of the tumor cells. 

Parosteal Osteosarcoma 
  This uncommon variant of osteosarcoma develops from the external surface of bone, the lesion produces a lobulated nodule attached to the cortex by a stalk. There is no elevation of the periosteum and no peripheral bone formation or regeneration. The tumor microscopically presents many wellformed bony trabaculae in a fibrocellular stroma. This tumor does not show the same degree of cellular pleomorphism as seen in case of the endosteal variety. It grows slowly and metastasizes late, and thereby has a much better prognosis.

Periosteal Osteosarcoma
 Periosteal osteosarcomas are sessile lesions, which arise from the cortex of the affected bone and cause elevation of the overlying periosteum. There are also significant periosteal new bone formations.

Clinically, NHL presents the usual features of a sarcomatous lesion.

• The patients may develop some constitutional symptoms like fever of unknown origin, fatigue, night sweats, pruritus, malaise, anorexia, dyspnea and weight loss, etc. along with generalized lymphadenopathy and abdominal pain, etc.

• Oral non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas frequently occur in association with HIV/AIDS.

• The nodal lesions produce slow enlarging, nontendered, freely movable swellings of long duration (6 months or above) and as the disease progresses more and more number of lymph nodes get involved.

• The affected lymph nodes become firm or rubbery in consistency and they often get fixed or matted together, and gradually the lesion invades directly into the adjacent tissue structures.

• In the oral cavity, the soft tissue lesions are characterized by fast enlarging, diffuse, exophytic, non-tendered, soft or firm swellings with boggy consistency.

• Misfitting dentures are common complaints for older individuals and it occurs due to gradual expansion of the jawbone due to the disease.

• The overlying surface epithelium appears red or purplish and inflamed, and extensive tissue necrosis often causes ulceration, bleeding and superadded candidal infections, etc.

• In the later stages of the disease, multiple lymph node groups are enlarged, e.g. meningeal and axillary, etc. along with hepatosplenomegaly.

• Nasopharyngeal lymphoma is a multifocal destructive disease, which frequently produces swelling and ulceration of the palate.

• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are the second most common malignancy in AIDS patients after Kaposi’s sarcoma.

• Intrabony lesion of the jaw initially produces vague pain and discomfort which mimics toothache, with further progression of the disease a large, expansile swelling develops in the jaw with pain, paresthesia and mobility of the regional teeth.

• Swelling of the gingiva and palate are common, and pathological fracture of the involved bone is also seen in some cases.

• The jaw lesions of the NHL occur either as central jaw lesions (called the primarylymphoma of bone) or they involve the jawbones secondarily as an extension from the nearby soft tissue lesions.

• The untreated central jaw lesions may cause perforation of the cortical plates and protrude outside the bone as a nontendered, lobulated soft tissue lump.

• Histologically, NHL is characterized by monotonous proliferation of malignant lymphocytes with varying degrees of differentiation.

• The cells are relatively uniform in size and they proliferate in broad sheets, generally there is no evidence of tissue necrosis or hemorrhage in the tumor

• Cellular pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromatism may be observed in few cells, with minimum amount of intervening connective tissue stroma.

• The malignant cells in NHL may be small in size and uniform in shape, and they can be readily recognized as lymphocytes. In other instances, the tumor cells may be very large and immature in appearance and they often resemble histiocytes.

• These malignant cells, whether large or small, are mostly arranged in two distinct patterns: (A) nodular pattern, and (B) diffuse pattern.– In the nodular pattern, the tumor cells (large or small) tend to aggregate in large clusters, which are separated from one another by very thin connective tissue septa.– The diffuse pattern of NHL is characterized by monotonous proliferation of tumor cells (large or small) within the connective tissue, with no evidence of cluster formation.

• Special staining with the help of reticulin stain helps in the differentiation between nodular and diffuse type of NHLs.

• In the oral cavity, the diffuse large cell type is the most common form of NHL.

Burkitt’s lymphoma is an uncommon, highly aggressive form non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B lymphocytic origin), which occurs commonly among the African children. This tumor is believed to be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and the disease frequently occurs in areas of malaria endemic. The tumor was first reported by Denis Burkitt (a surgeon) in 1958.
''';
  static const String clinicalFeatures = '''
Age: Burkitt’s lymphoma occurs commonly at the age of about 1 to 3 years.

Sex: More commonly seen among male children.

Site: The tumor predominantly involves the extra nodal areas. Maxilla and mandible are the most frequently affected sites in the head and neck region, however maxilla is more frequently affected than mandible. The lesion can also develop from the other visceral organs like ovary, kidney, liver and endocrine glands, etc.

Pathogenesis: It has been observed that Burkitt’s lymphomas occur commonly in the geographic areas, where the malarial infections are very common.

    The most accepted explanation for this phenomenon is that acute malarial infections cause reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and as a result body’s control over the proliferation of “EpsteinBarr virus specific B lymphocytes” is lost. This results in an increased abnormal neoplastic proliferation of B lymphocytes, leading to the development of Burkitt’s lymphoma.
    
    Chromosomal abnormality is believed to be the most important factor in the development of Burkitt’s lymphoma. In this neoplasm, translocation of a portion of chromosome 8 to chromosome 2, 14 and 22 is often observed, which results in over expression of the C-myc oncogene. Over expression of C-myc oncogene, which is a DNAbinding transcription protein results in the activation of cell cycling in B lymphocytes. 
''';
  static const String types = '''
Burkitt’s lymphoma is generally divided into three forms:

    Endemic form (African type): This is the most common type and is seen in children in equatorial Africa, where the incidence rate is highest and where malaria is also very prevalent.
    
    Non-endemic or sporadic (non-African) form: Burkitt’s lymphoma is very uncommon outside Africa, hence it is called the sporadic form, but otherwise it is same as the African form.
    
    Immunodeficiency associated form: Occurs in adults with HIV infection or organ transplant patients undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy.
    
According to WHO Burkitt’s lymphomas are classified into three types:

• Classic Burkitt’s lymphoma
• Burkitt’s lymphoma with plasmacytoid proliferations
• A typical Burkitt’s/Burkitt-like lymphoma.

• The earliest sign of the disease is characterized by rapid painless expansile swelling of the jaws with loosening of teeth, it starts from the posterior part of the jaw and gradually moves to the anterior area.

• Within a short span of time the lesion produces gross deformity of the face and proptosis of the eyeball.

• The nature of the swelling is usually massive, painless and uniform, and it often causes facial asymmetry.

• The mucosa overlying the tumor is often ulcerated and there can be areas of hemorrhage.

• Toothache itself is a frequent complaint among these patients (especially adults), which occurs due to the invasion and damage of dental pulp by tumor cells.

• The tumor cells frequently involve the mental and the infraorbital nerves, damage to these nerves often leads to paresthesia or anesthesia of the related structures. Paraplegia in the facial region is also common

• Peripheral lymphadenopathy is uncommon in Burkitt’s lymphomas.

• Advanced lesions of Burkitt’s lymphoma produce massive expansion of the jaw with displacement of teeth, derangement of the dental arch and malocclusion, etc.

• As the tumor mass increases in size, it causes massive enlargement of the gingiva or the alveolar process in the jaw, as a result many deciduous or even permanent teeth are pushed out of their socket and some of which may exfoliate prematurely.

• Sometimes, the tumor is so large that it may fill up the entire oral cavity, in such cases a large tumor mass often protrudes outside the mouth, which contains many rootless teeth.

• Maxillary tumors besides causing massive bony expansions also produce bilateral, soft and spongy swellings of the buccal and the palatal mucosa.

• Although the tumor is solitary, there can be more than one individual tumor affecting different jaw quadrants.

• Some tumors cause perforation of the cortical plates of jawbone and in such cases, a soft tissue lump often protrudes from these perforated openings.

• Abdominal swelling is also common in Burkitt’s lymphomas and the tumor cells frequently invade the kidney and the ovary, etc.

• In AIDS patients, Burkitt’s lymphoma often produces a soft nodular mass in the palate, which has severe hemorrhagic tendency. Such lesions frequently resemble the Kaposi’s sarcoma.

• Involvement of the maxillary antrum is common and these patients often have epistaxis and pressure in the eyeball.

• Burkitt’s lymphoma is a multifocal tumor and besides the face, it simultaneously affects multiple organs in the body.

• Radiographically, Burkitt’s lymphoma presents a large, irregular radiolucent area in the bone with a ragged ‘moth-eaten’ appearance.

• In the initial stages of the disease, there are multiple small radiolucent foci seen in the jaw, these small lesions coalesce together with time to form a large, massive defect in the bone.

• The earliest sign of the disease is the loss of lamina dura and enlargement of the crypt of the developing tooth, which occur due to involvement of the dental papilla by the tumor cells.

• Tooth displacement and root resorption are common.

• Some lesions cause blurring of the shadow of maxillary antrum.

• Widening of the periodontal ligament space occurs due to invasion of the tumor cells in the area.

• Pathological fracture of the bone is seen in few cases.

• Histologically, Burkitt’s lymphoma is characterized by monotonous proliferation of small, non-cleaved B-lymphocytes in diffuse sheets.

• These malignant lymphocytes often have large round nuclei with prominent nuclear membrane, moreover they also exhibit stippled nucleoplasm, prominent nucleoli and minimal cytoplasm.

• Each nucleus is surrounded by a cytoplasm, which gives the sheets of neoplastic cells a syncytial appearance.

• The mitotic activity is abundant and this tumor probably shows the fastest rate of cell multiplication among all malignant lesions (each cell doubles itself in just 24 hours).

• Numerous macrophages with abundant clear cytoplasm containing cellular debris are usually found scattered uniformly throughout the tumor and this often gives rise to a very characteristic “starry-sky” appearance.

• The starry-sky appearance occurs because in Burkitt’s lymphoma the macrophages have abundant cytoplasm but are less intensely stained, therefore these cells stand out as ‘stars’ set against the ‘night sky’ of deeply hyperchromatic malignant lymphocytes.

• The malignant cells often invade into the periodontal ligament tissue and some cells can even invade into the dental pulp.

• Few multinucleated giant cells may also be seen within the tumors.

• Patients also suffer from nausea, vomiting and marked anemia, etc.

• Increased bleeding tendency with petechial hemorrhage in the skin and mucous membrane due to severe fall in the number of platelets.

• There are also increased chances of renal complications as the kidney is overburdened by the excess and abnormal protein production in the body by the neoplastic plasma cells.

• In multiple myeloma, jaw lesions occur in about 15 percent cases, initially these jaw lesions produce pain that often simulates toothache.

• In the early stages of the disease, the jaw swellings are unremarkable, since the tumor cells occupy only the marrow spaces during this period.

• The jaw lesions in advanced stages, however produce fast enlarging, painful swelling, with expansion and destruction of the bone.

• Severe bone destruction may lead to the “eggshell cracking” or pathological fractures.

• The regional teeth in the jaw are usually mobile due to weakness of the bone and as a result malocclusion often develops.

• Perforation of the bony cortex by the neoplastic cells often causes protrusion of the lesion outside the bone as an ulcerated, fleshly lump.

• Extraction of teeth in these patients usually causes severe uncontrolled hemorrhage and delayed wound healing.

• Multiple myelomas sometimes cause immunosuppression and thereby increase the risk of secondary infection, in the oral cavity; this often results in candidiasis and oral hairy leukoplakia.
